## Introduction

##### The purpose of Travelogue is to allow users to keep track of their favorite places and memories from their travels around the United States.

## How it Works

### Creating an Account

##### Users can create an account from the link at the bottom of the title page.

### Adding Journals

##### Users can add journals from the link in the navigation bar, or by viewing their journals from their main page and clicking the add journal button.  Journals are meant to store favorite memories, as well as dates of travel and the state traveled. 

### Adding Places

##### Users can add places from the link in the navigation bar, or by viewing their journals from their main page and clicking the add place button.  Places are meant to store favorite places visited, such as museums, restaurants, and bars.  No more forgetting that one fried chicken place with the great long islands you visited once in Louisiana! Users can also leave a review of the place, and like journals, it is stored by the state visited.
